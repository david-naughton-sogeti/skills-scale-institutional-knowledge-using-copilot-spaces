## Overview of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme’s project management processes unite clear roles, iterative workflows, and open communication to accelerate project delivery and learning. Projects are guided through standard phases:

1. **Initiation**: Validate the business need, define the problem and goals, identify stakeholders and champions, outline success criteria, and gain alignment.
2. **Planning**: Break work into increments, create action backlogs, align timelines, estimate effort, define dependencies and risks, and confirm the Definition of Done.
3. **Execution & Tracking**: Operate with daily standups, weekly syncs, and demos; manage tasks on project boards; use PR conventions, CI checks, and metrics tracking; escalate issues promptly via clear levels.
4. **Release & Deployment**: Standardize releases for predictability and risk management, use formal deployment and rollback checklists, communicate releases to stakeholders.
5. **Retrospective & Improvement**: Run regular retrospectives after major milestones; convert learnings into action items to feed continuous improvement.

### Key Workflows & Artifacts
- Project board columns: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done
- Pull request, test, and CI standards
- Risk registers and escalation paths for blockers
- Project Charter/One-pager, Roadmap, Sprint Backlog, Acceptance Criteria, Retrospectives

### Personas/Roles
- **Product Manager**: Prioritizes backlog, defines outcomes, and measures value.
- **Project Manager**: Coordinates delivery, risks, and team communications.
- **Developers**: Build, test, review, and deliver code, supporting planning and quality.
- **QA/Testers**: Validate acceptance and quality standards through automated and manual tests.
- **Stakeholders**: Provide key input, approve milestones, and receive regular updates.

### Communication & Quality Assurance
- Daily standups, weekly syncs, regular demos, monthly stakeholder updates.
- Clear, structured escalation paths from team-level to sponsor.
- Quality baked in through CI/CD pipelines, test automation, linting, manual QA, and incident playbooks.
